# Java OOP Programs üöÄ

This repository contains simple Java programs demonstrating **Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** like classes, objects, constructors, methods, and encapsulation.

## Programs Included

### 1. Book.java
- Tracks total number of books using a **static variable**.
- Demonstrates **constructor overloading**.
- Methods to **borrow** and **return** a book with proper state management.

### 2. Car.java
- Simulates a real-life car.
- Handles **fuel level, reserve mode, and driving logic**.
- Includes **methods** to add fuel and check current fuel level.
### EXAMPLE OUTPUT
```
Total number of books: 2
enjoy reading "Design"!
enjoy reading "unknown"!
Book "Design" is already borrowed:
Hope you enjoyed "Design", please leave a review.
The book "Design" is already in the library.

car is driving
car is driving
car is in reserved mode !! refuel the car:
car is driving
7.0
```
## üöÄ Conclusion
These programs are small but powerful examples to understand the basics of **Object Oriented Programming in Java**.  
You can extend them further by adding more features (like inheritance, polymorphism, or exception handling).
